# How to find assignments in Canvas (your course dashboard)


## 1). Click on where it says grades on the left side of the dashboard.

## 3). The score tells you the score out of total score possible. If this score happens to be a 0 or a "-", then you need to still complete the assignment or you made a 0 on it.

## 4). If you want to view the details of you submission, then click on the "Name" of the assignment itself. Doing so will take you to the "detailed grade" page of that assignment. Doing so does NOT take you to the assignment itself.

## 5). On the page where you can see the "detailed grade", you should be able to see any comments, submission, etc. To navigate to the assignment itself, click at the top of the page where the "actual link" to the assignment exists.
